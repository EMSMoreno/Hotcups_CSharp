Excited to share a collaborative project I've been working on w/ @rrenildopereiraa
Introducing a Beverage Vending Machine Simulator developed in C# w/ Windows Forms.

ðŸ”¹ Ever wondered how beverage vending machines work behind the scenes? Our simulator provides a peek into the inner workings, allowing end-users to interactively select and receive their favourite hot drinks;

ðŸ”¹ Developed using C#, this project showcases our skills in OOP and UI;

ðŸ”¹ Huge thanks to rrenildopereiraa for the fantastic collaboration! Together, we've brought this idea to life and learned so much along the way.
